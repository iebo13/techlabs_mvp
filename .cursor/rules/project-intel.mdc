Purpose
- Capture patterns, preferences, decisions, and caveats discovered during work.

Workflow
1) Identify a reusable pattern or insight
2) Validate with user when non-obvious or high-impact
3) Record succinctly here (link to code/Memory Bank section)
4) run the precommit-checks always at the end and fix the error 

Guidelines
- Keep entries atomic and dated; prefer links to code and docs.
- Examples: API error shape, testing heuristics, layout primitives, naming rules, release process.
