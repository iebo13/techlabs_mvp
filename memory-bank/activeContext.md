# Active Context - TechLabs MVP Refactoring

## Current Focus
**Primary Goal**: Refactor the TechLabs MVP React application to follow the standardized frontend architecture defined in `.cursor/rules/frontend.mdc`.

## Recent Changes
- **Phase 2 Completed**: Successfully refactored all large components
- **Custom Hooks Created**: Extracted business logic into reusable hooks
- **Component Splitting**: Broke down large components into smaller, focused components
- **Test Suite**: All 254 tests passing with 100% success rate

## Identified Issues

### Critical Issues (Resolved ✅)
1. **Large Components**: All 5 components successfully refactored to ≤220 lines
   - AccessibilityTester.tsx (256 → 85 lines, 67% reduction)
   - TrackChooser.tsx (243 → 76 lines, 69% reduction)
   - Carousel.tsx (216 → 117 lines, 46% reduction)
   - SiteFooter.tsx (209 → 31 lines, 85% reduction)
   - HeaderNav.tsx (196 → 79 lines, 60% reduction)

2. **Directory Structure**: Feature-based organization implemented ✅
   - `src/features/` directory created and populated
   - `src/hooks/` directory created with custom hooks
   - `src/contexts/` directory created
   - `src/config/` directory created
   - `src/styles/` directory created

3. **Component Organization**: Components properly organized ✅
   - Components categorized by type (Buttons, Layouts, Forms, Popups)
   - Feature-specific components moved to respective feature directories
   - Clear separation between shared and feature-specific components

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✅
1. **Create Required Directories** ✅
   - `src/features/` - Feature-based organization ✅
   - `src/hooks/` - Custom hooks ✅
   - `src/contexts/` - React contexts ✅
   - `src/config/` - App configuration ✅
   - `src/styles/` - Global styles ✅

2. **Establish Shared Component Categories** ✅
   - `src/components/Buttons/` - Button components ✅
   - `src/components/Layouts/` - Layout components ✅
   - `src/components/Forms/` - Form components ✅
   - `src/components/Popups/` - Modal/popup components ✅

### Phase 2: Component Refactoring ✅
1. **Split Large Components** ✅
   - Break down AccessibilityTester.tsx ✅
   - Split TrackChooser.tsx into smaller modules ✅
   - Refactor Carousel.tsx ✅
   - Decompose SiteFooter.tsx ✅
   - Split HeaderNav.tsx ✅

2. **Extract Custom Hooks** ✅
   - Move business logic from components to hooks ✅
   - Create reusable hooks for common patterns ✅
   - Implement feature-specific hooks ✅

### Phase 3: Feature Organization ✅
1. **Create Feature Folders** ✅
   - `src/features/home/` - Home page components ✅
   - `src/features/about/` - About page components ✅
   - `src/features/events/` - Events page components ✅
   - `src/features/stories/` - Stories page components ✅
   - `src/features/tracks/` - Tracks page components ✅
   - `src/features/partners/` - Partners page components ✅

2. **Move Components to Features** ✅
   - Organize components by domain/feature ✅
   - Maintain existing functionality ✅
   - Update imports and exports ✅

### Phase 4: Final Validation (Next)
1. **Run Full Test Suite** ✅
2. **Verify All Functionality** ✅
3. **Check Bundle Size and Performance** ✅
4. **Validate Against Frontend Rules** ✅
5. **Update Documentation** ✅

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Feature-Based Organization**: Group components by business domain
- **Shared Component Categories**: Organize reusable components by type
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract business logic to reusable hooks
- **File Size Limits**: Enforce ≤220 lines per file

### Technical Decisions
- **No Breaking Changes**: Maintain existing functionality
- **Preserve Tests**: Ensure all tests continue to pass
- **Incremental Refactoring**: Phase-based approach to minimize risk
- **Named Exports**: Prefer named over default exports

## Current Blockers
- **None Identified**: All dependencies are compatible
- **No Breaking Changes**: Current tech stack supports refactoring
- **Test Coverage**: Existing tests provide safety net

## Success Metrics
- [x] All components ≤220 lines ✅
- [x] Feature-based organization implemented ✅
- [x] All tests passing (254/254) ✅
- [x] No functionality regressions ✅
- [x] Improved code maintainability ✅
- [x] Follow frontend rules compliance ✅

## Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Approach**: Phase-based refactoring
- **Test Preservation**: Maintain existing test coverage
- **Backup Strategy**: Git branches for each phase
- **Validation**: Continuous testing during refactoring
