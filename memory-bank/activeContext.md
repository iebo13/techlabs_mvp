- **Custom Metrics**: API calls, bundle loading, component rendering
- **React Hook**: `usePerformance` for component-level tracking
- **Factory Pattern**: No-classes approach following project standards
- **Configurable**: Debug mode, sampling rates, analytics endpoints

### Development Workflow Improvements
- **New NPM Scripts**:
  - `npm run check:all` - Comprehensive quality checks
  - `npm run build:analyze` - Bundle analysis
  - `npm run performance` - Performance testing
  - `npm run lighthouse` - Lighthouse audits
  - `npm run lint:staged` - Staged file linting

- **Pre-commit Hooks**:
  - Lint-staged configuration for staged files
  - Comprehensive quality check script
  - Husky integration for automated gates

### Quality Gates Implemented
1. **Type Safety** - TypeScript compilation
