- Breakpoint customization beyond MUI defaults

## Cross-Epic Awareness

**Header Navigation (MVP-03)** will immediately need:

- Theme breakpoints for responsive behavior
- Typography tokens for nav links
- Z-index layering for sticky header

**Homepage sections (MVP-05+)** will need:

- Section wrapper component
- Heading hierarchy and styling
- Responsive typography (esp. Hero clamp sizing)

## Quality Gates

- Theme contrast verification (WCAG AA)
- Component consistency check
- Documentation completeness
- Responsive behavior validation

## Files to Focus On

**Creating:**

- `src/theme/theme.ts` - Main theme configuration
- `src/theme/README.md` - Theme documentation
- `src/components/Section.tsx` - Layout wrapper
- `src/components/SectionHeading.tsx` - Typography component

**Updating:**
