# Progress - TechLabs MVP Refactoring

## Current Status
**Phase**: Planning and Documentation Complete
**Next Phase**: Infrastructure Setup

## What Works (Current State)
- **Application Functionality**: All pages and features working correctly
- **Build Process**: Vite build and development server working
- **Testing**: All existing tests passing
- **Styling**: MUI theme and responsive design working
- **Routing**: React Router navigation working
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation working
- **Data Fetching**: React Query integration working

## Completed Tasks
- [x] **Memory Bank Creation**: All core documentation files created
- [x] **Current State Analysis**: Documented existing architecture and issues
- [x] **Component Analysis**: Identified large components and feature groupings
- [x] **Tech Stack Review**: Confirmed all dependencies are compatible
- [x] **Refactoring Plan**: Established phase-based approach

## What's Left (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Next)
- [ ] Create `src/features/` directory structure
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/` directory
- [ ] Create `src/contexts/` directory
- [ ] Create `src/config/` directory
- [ ] Create `src/styles/` directory
- [ ] Reorganize `src/components/` into categories
  - [ ] Create `src/components/Buttons/`
  - [ ] Create `src/components/Layouts/`
  - [ ] Create `src/components/Forms/`
  - [ ] Create `src/components/Popups/`

### Phase 2: Component Refactoring
- [ ] Split large components (>220 lines)
  - [ ] Refactor AccessibilityTester.tsx (256 lines)
  - [ ] Split TrackChooser.tsx (243 lines)
  - [ ] Break down Carousel.tsx (216 lines)
  - [ ] Decompose SiteFooter.tsx (209 lines)
  - [ ] Split HeaderNav.tsx (196 lines)
- [ ] Extract custom hooks
  - [ ] Create reusable hooks for common patterns
  - [ ] Move business logic from components to hooks
  - [ ] Implement feature-specific hooks

### Phase 3: Feature Organization
- [ ] Create feature folders
  - [ ] `src/features/home/`
  - [ ] `src/features/about/`
  - [ ] `src/features/events/`
  - [ ] `src/features/stories/`
  - [ ] `src/features/tracks/`
  - [ ] `src/features/partners/`
- [ ] Move components to appropriate feature folders
- [ ] Update imports and exports
- [ ] Ensure all tests continue to pass

### Phase 4: Final Validation
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify all functionality works
- [ ] Check bundle size and performance
- [ ] Validate against frontend rules
- [ ] Update documentation

## Known Issues

### Current Issues (Pre-Refactoring)
1. **Large Components**: 5 components exceed 220 lines
2. **Flat Structure**: No feature-based organization
3. **Mixed Concerns**: UI, logic, and data handling in single files
4. **No Custom Hooks**: Business logic embedded in components
5. **Missing Infrastructure**: No centralized config or hooks

### Potential Issues During Refactoring
1. **Import Path Changes**: Need to update all import statements
2. **Test Dependencies**: Tests may need path updates
3. **Component Coupling**: Tight dependencies may complicate splitting
4. **Build Process**: May need to update build configuration

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Directory Creation**: Simple file system operations
- **Component Categorization**: Moving files to appropriate folders
- **Import Updates**: Straightforward path changes

### Medium Risk
- **Component Splitting**: Breaking down large components
- **Custom Hook Extraction**: Moving logic between files
- **Test Updates**: Ensuring tests continue to work

### High Risk
- **Functionality Regressions**: Ensuring no features break
- **Performance Impact**: Maintaining current performance levels
- **Build Issues**: Potential build configuration problems

## Success Metrics Tracking
- [ ] **File Size Compliance**: All components â‰¤220 lines
- [ ] **Feature Organization**: Components organized by feature
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: All tests passing
- [ ] **Functionality**: No regressions
- [ ] **Performance**: Maintain or improve current metrics
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Improved maintainability scores

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Create Infrastructure Directories**: Set up required folder structure
2. **Plan Component Splitting**: Design approach for large components
3. **Establish Shared Categories**: Organize reusable components
4. **Begin Phase 1**: Start infrastructure setup

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days (Infrastructure setup)
- **Phase 2**: 3-5 days (Component refactoring)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days (Feature organization)
- **Phase 4**: 1 day (Final validation)
- **Total**: 7-11 days for complete refactoring
