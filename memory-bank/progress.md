# Project Progress - TechLabs MVP

## Performance Optimization Phase ✅ COMPLETED

### React Component Optimizations ✅
- **React.memo Implementation**: All major components now use memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **useMemo Usage**: Expensive calculations and object creations are memoized
- **useCallback Implementation**: Event handlers are memoized to prevent child re-renders
- **Components Optimized**: HeroSection, TrackChooserSection, StoriesCarousel, LazyPage, OptimizedImage

### Bundle Optimization ✅
- **Enhanced Chunk Splitting**: 23 optimized chunks for better caching
- **Vendor Splitting**: React, MUI Core, MUI Icons, Emotion separated
- **Feature Chunks**: Home, Stories, About, Tracks, Events, Partners
- **Component Chunks**: Layouts, Forms, Buttons, Popups
- **Utility Chunks**: Utils, Hooks, Theme

### Performance Monitoring ✅
- **Reduced Sampling**: From 100% to 5-10% sampling for better performance
- **Conditional Monitoring**: Only active in production or when explicitly enabled
- **Throttled Metrics**: Prevents metric spam and reduces overhead
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old metrics

### New Performance Components ✅
- **OptimizedImage**: Lazy loading with intersection observer and loading states
- **Enhanced LazyPage**: Better error boundaries and loading states
- **Performance Hooks**: Optimized usePerformance hook for component tracking

## Final Results

### Bundle Analysis
- **Total Bundle Size**: 662.81 KB (273.32 KB gzipped)
- **Chunk Count**: 23 optimized chunks
- **Vendor Chunks**: 6 optimized vendor chunks
- **Feature Chunks**: 5 feature-specific chunks
- **Component Chunks**: 4 component category chunks
- **Utility Chunks**: 3 utility and hook chunks

### Performance Improvements
- **React Rendering**: Optimized with memo, useMemo, useCallback
- **Bundle Caching**: Better chunk organization for improved caching
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Reduced from 100% to 5-10% sampling
- **Image Loading**: Lazy loading with intersection observer
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error boundaries and loading states
