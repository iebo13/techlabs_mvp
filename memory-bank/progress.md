# Project Progress - TechLabs MVP

## Current Phase: Lighthouse Performance Optimization 🚀

### Lighthouse Performance Audit Results 📊
- **Overall Performance Score**: 0.45/1.0 (Poor)
- **Critical Issues Identified**: Slow loading, missing images, poor Core Web Vitals
- **Target**: Achieve 0.9+ performance score with <2.5s LCP

### Current Performance Metrics (Critical Issues)
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: 4.4s (Score: 0.16/1.0) - **Critical**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: 5.5s (Score: 0.19/1.0) - **Critical**
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: 230ms (Score: 0.86/1.0) - **Good**
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: 0.42 (Score: 0.23/1.0) - **Critical**
- **Speed Index**: 4.4s (Score: 0.74/1.0) - **Needs Improvement**

### Critical Issues to Address
1. **Missing Images (404s)**: Partner logos and hero images not found
2. **Slow Initial Load**: FCP and LCP significantly above recommended thresholds
3. **Layout Instability**: High CLS score indicating poor user experience
4. **Resource Loading**: Inefficient asset loading and caching

### Performance Targets
- **LCP**: <2.5s (currently 5.5s) - **Priority 1**
- **FCP**: <1.8s (currently 4.4s) - **Priority 1**
- **CLS**: <0.1 (currently 0.42) - **Priority 1**
- **Overall Score**: 0.9+ (currently 0.45) - **Target**
